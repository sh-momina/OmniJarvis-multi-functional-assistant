## 🌟 Overview

OmniJarvis blends **computer vision**, **speech recognition**, and **AI generation** to create a human-like assistant experience.  
Once the system recognizes your face, you can interact naturally through speech or gestures — and it will respond, automate tasks, search the web, generate content, or even create AI images.

You simply **train the system on your face once**, and then just **run `main.py`** to unlock your personal assistant.

## 🧠 Core Functionalities

### 1. **Face Recognition Authentication**
- Before using OmniJarvis, you need to collect and train face data.  
- The system captures your face images and builds a trained recognition model.
- Once trained, OmniJarvis verifies your identity every time it runs.  
- Only verified users can activate the assistant, ensuring security and personalization.

**Workflow:**
1. Run the **data collection script** to record your face (using webcam).  
2. Train the model on your collected face data.  
3. Run `main.py` — the system will detect and recognize you automatically.  
4. Once verified, OmniJarvis greets you and starts interacting.
